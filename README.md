# Final-Apple-Picker
 CS-382 Game Dev Project 1

This basic C#/Unity game was used to help learn the basics of the Game Engine and C# Programming. 
The objective of the game was to catch apples falling from a tree in a basket to score points.

In addition to the basic requirements for the game, I added a tree branch that the user should avoid or else the game will end. These branches fall much less frequently than the apples do. I also added a round counter to the top, where every 1,000 points the round will increase. I also added a restart button from the Game Over Menu, and if you reach 5,000 points, you win the game which also has a restart button. Restarting resets your round, and your points, but the high score remains saved.

### **Still to implement (but not required) fun additions:**

-Increased difficulty (Faster apples falling, faster tree movement, more objects to avoid)

-Bonus points for special items (Gold Apples)

-Better scene background

-Better textured basket
